						Halo Salon was established in June 2001. The owner and our staff all have between 5 and 30 years of experience. Because we have known and worked with each other for years, we are truly grateful and believe that it shows in the quality of our service.This salon is made up of many knowledgeable stylists. The education and product knowledge that we have obtained is unsurpassed. The stylists at Halo have a deep commitment to the Bumble and bumble line of hair care products. The staff attends cutting and product knowledge classes at BbU annually. The University of Bumble and bumble is located in the Meat Packing District in New York City. The professionalism and inspiration that is experienced there is beyond belief!
